The intention of this file is to use a main funciton block to call a function described in the file. 

When the file is called from the terminal, it calles the main function. 
When it is used withing a pipeline, it calles the funciton itself without executing the main fucniton. 

This way this small block is able to be tested alone, or used in context of a bigger program without changing the code itself.
